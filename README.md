# DNP3 SAv6 reference implementation

This is the reference implementation for the DNP3 secure session layer (called SAv6 for historical reasons). It is developed in conjunction with the SAv6 specification and aims to be a reference for implementors of the specification as well as a proof-of-concept for the specification's development.

The implementation itself is developed in modern C++ and is a single-threaded event-driven protocol stack.
